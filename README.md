# Princy Doshi

Graduate student in Computer Engineering at NYU Tandon  
Focused on applying machine learning and MLOps to real-world problems

---

I specialize in designing scalable ML pipelines, automating workflows, and enhancing AI model robustness, with experience in adversarial attack defense and image authenticity detection.

My toolkit includes Python, SQL, JavaScript, and C++, along with frameworks and tools like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Docker, MLflow, and Ray. I also work with databases such as Oracle DB and MySQL, and have practical knowledge of REST APIs, MEAN Stack, and NLP including large language models.

I approach problems with a blend of technical rigor and practical deployment in mind, aiming to build systems that bridge research insights with production needs.
